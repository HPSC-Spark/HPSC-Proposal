\section*{Introduction}
Put background information in subsections here \cite{fenn-dtk2006b}

% what is map-reduce, history, applications (1 Ref Paper) 
%   - origin, date, creators, original purpose
%   - growing popularity, expanding applications
%   - common technologies/tools, Hadoop
% Janus description, why Janus can't use hadoop (1 Ref Paper) 
%   - what, where is it
%   - architecture, hardware: number of nodes, procs, storage
%   - focus on diskless, common for HPC?
%   - has not yet employed MR technologies
%   - problem with Hadoop and diskless
% what is spark, differs from hadoop 
%   - spark another MR solution, but all in-memory, year created
%   - solves the diskless problem, can run on janus
%   - other contrasts with hadoop, prefered domains
%         - iterative, interactive, beyond MapReduce

\section*{Existing Performance Evaluations }
% existing profiling metric, tools, results (1-2 Ref Paper) 
%   - fairly new technology, not as well studied/supported
%   - some studies have been made (MR/Haddop in general):
%         - detail studies 1: what, how, findings
%         - detail studies 2: what, how, findings
%         - detail studies 3: what, how, findings
% spark specific tools, results, or lack there of 
%   - few studies, new technology
%         - detail studies 1: what, how, findings
%         - detail studies 2: what, how, findings

\section*{Proposal}
% room for further research
%   - whate are questions we can still try to answer
%   - how does Janus make this a special case

\subsection*{Setup/Profiling}

% profile performance of spark on Janus 
% find/address weak points/Janus-specific problems 
% possible areas to focus on during evaluation:
%   - too big for memory (benchmarking on this specific problem) 
%   - data shuffling work 
%   - network congestion 
%   - iterations
%   - load balancing

\subsection*{Implementing Project X}

% time-permitting, employ spark on a project
% brief intro to topic/problem (1-2 Ref Paper) 
% how does it lend itself to MapReduce (Spark) approach
% overview of design/implementation
% profile program and improve performance 
% using insight gained from phase one profiling
% model for future MR applications on Janus

%%% current ideas (input still needed):
%%% - Ray-tracing
%%% - NLP of Twitter (or similar) Data
%%% - Neural Networks

\section*{Process/Schedule}
% monte is our sponsor/advisor
% expected timeline/milestone dates
%   - install, play, understand
%   - device test problems, collect data
%   - find-setup / develop metrics
%   - run test and varying problems sets
%   - analyze results
% reiterate "project implementation" will be approach if time allows
%   - general milestones

\section*{Conclusion}

% sum up MR's importance
% restate project goals
% add info to relatively new field
