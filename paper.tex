\section*{Introduction}
MapReduce\citep{dean-mapreduce} is a programming paradigm for performing highly
parallel tasks on large sets of data. Designed at Google to provide an
abstraction for interacting with raw data at scale, MapReduce is based on
a master/slave model, where the workers are assigned tasks as they become idle.

MapReduce is named after the two kinds of tasks that workers can be assigned.
A \emph{Map} is a user-defined function of type
$(k_1 \times v_1) \rightarrow list \: (k_2 \times v_2)$.
That is, it takes a key-value pair and produces a list of
intermediate key-value pairs. \emph{Reduce} has type
$(k_1 \times list \: v_1) \rightarrow list \: v_2$.
% what is map-reduce, history, applications (1 Ref Paper) 
%   - origin, date, creators, original purpose
%   - growing popularity, expanding applications
%   - common technologies/tools, Hadoop
% Janus description, why Janus can't use hadoop (1 Ref Paper) 
%   - what, where is it
%   - architecture, hardware: number of nodes, procs, storage
%   - focus on disk-less, common for HPC?
%   - has not yet employed MR technologies
%   - problem with Hadoop and disk-less
% what is spark, differs from hadoop 
% Spark\citep{zaharia}
%   - spark another MR solution, but all in-memory, year created
%   - solves the disk-less problem, can run on Janus
%   - other contrasts with hadoop, preferred domains
%         - iterative, interactive, beyond MapReduce
%   - what is shark (do we want to use Shark in our project?)
%       - shark comes with its own set of benchmark queries

\section*{Existing Performance Evaluations }
Despite being a relatively new technology, a considerable amount of performance
evaluations has been performed on the wide array of MapReduce solutions.
In Google's first paper introduction MapReduce, they provided a number of
example tasks in which MapReduce can be applied. A few of those listed were
word count, distributed grep, counting URL access frequency, \& reverse web-link
graph\citep{dean-mapreduce}. These examples have often been implemented for
benchmarking other MapReduce technologies and gives us a initial point in which
to start our evaluation of Spark on Janus.

%% Assuming Hadoop reference above
Hadoop, being is one of the more popular MapReduce frameworks, has been in a
number of different studies. For this reason (and its large constrast in how
it utilizes memory and disk storage), Hadoop will make for an interesting
comparision with Spark.

% performance of mapreduce: an in-depth study
% written in Java
% Hadoop\citep{jiang}

% spark specific tools, results, or lack there of 
%   - even few studies, new technology far newer
%         - detail studies 1: what, how, findings
%               "Performance and Scalability of Broadcast in Spark"
%               determined broadcast limited scalability
%               compares performance of Spark vs Hadoop on Logistic Reg prob
%               times during first and second iterations
%               ratio: computation vs broadcast times during an iteration
% Broadcast\citep{chowdhury}

% introduction to shark
%   SQL interface for spark
%   abstracts coding mapreduce functions
%   - shark study results
% Shark\citep{engle}

\section*{Proposal}
% room for further research
%   - what are questions we can still try to answer
%   - how does Janus make this a special case
%       - make very Janus specific

\subsection*{Setup/Profiling}
% do same grep test as google & hadoop

% profile performance of spark on Janus 
% existing technologies for MR
% possibility of adapting these benchmarks to run on Janus
% find/address weak points/Janus-specific problems 
% possible areas to focus on during evaluation:
%   - too big for memory (benchmarking on this specific problem) 
%   - data shuffling work 
%   - network congestion 
%   - iterative, interactive analysis
%   - load balancing
%   - fault tolerance
% create models that can be used both others in the future
%   - guide for what hardware requirements are needed for given problems

\subsection*{Implementing Project X}

% time-permitting, employ spark on a project
% brief intro to topic/problem (1-2 Ref Paper) 
% how does it lend itself to MapReduce (Spark) approach
% overview of design/implementation
% profile program and improve performance 
% using insight gained from phase one profiling
% model for future MR applications on Janus

%%% current ideas (input still needed):
%%% - Ray-tracing
%%% - NLP of Twitter (or similar) Data
%%% - Neural Networks

\section*{Process/Schedule}
% Monte is our sponsor/advisor
% expected time-line/milestone dates
%   - install, play, understand
%   - device test problems, collect data
%   - find-setup / develop metrics
%   - run test and varying problems sets
%   - analyze results
% reiterate "project implementation" will be approach if time allows
%   - general milestones

\section*{Conclusion}

% sum up MR's importance
% setup on Janus, test, evaluate
% path for research to be conducted in future
% restate project goals
% specific conditions of Janus
% add info to relatively new field
